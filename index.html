            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Shacklette family menu, and enjoy some recipes that we have been making or recently discovered. Some of us are picky eaters. This is just a quick reference or a quick way to decide what to make.

        <div id="Inner-Thoughts">
            <h3>Second Text Area</h3>
            <p>This is the second area of text. I have no idea what to put here. Yes, I have just resorted to typing my thoughts as text onn this webpage. I am not sure how long i can keep doing this. It is just starting to get funny now, and the more i read and the more I type, I just want to go home.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Continued-Thoughts">
            <h3>Third Text Area</h3>
            <p>Hi. I am back. I didn't think I was gonna come up with anything else, but I guess that I figured something out. I cant believe you are still reading this. Are my thoughts really interesting enough for you to continue reading this. Oh well, at least I am not the only one left in my insanity.</p>
        </div>
        <div id= "Just-Stop">
            <h3>Fourth Text Area</h3>
            <p>This is getting rediculous now. I am starting to wonder if I am feeling ok. The more I type the less my brain actually stays working. I almost feel like I am zoning out in this. The perfectionist in me keeps going back and checking spelling mistakes. Even though I am gonna delete all of this later. </p>
        </div>
        <div id= "Done">
            <h3>Fifth Text Area</h3>
            <p>I am just done with this. Wake me up tomorrow when you are finished doing stuff like this. If you are reading this, you need to stop too. You are reading the inner thoughts of another human being who is arguing with himself through the whole process. Good night and don't stay up to late otherwise we will both be upset with you. </p>

    <div class= "Footer">
        <h2>Footer</h2>
        <p>This is the Footer. There is not really supposed to be any text in these usually, but i guess mine will be a little differant.</p>
